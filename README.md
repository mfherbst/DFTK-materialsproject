# Replicate Materials Project data with DFTK

Replicate formation energy data on the [Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/)
using the [density-functional toolkit (DFTK)](https://dftk.org/) as closely as possible.
Since the precise required methods are not yet available in DFTK the results differ from
the Materials Project data.

See the `run.jl` script for an example use case.
